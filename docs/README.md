Some basic contributing guidelines can be found below:

- Bug fixes are the best and always welcome! Like [this one](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/pull/421/files).
- If you don't understand the code you are changing, don't change it!
- All code golf PRs will be closed, but [conceptual cleanups](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/pull/372/files) are great.
- Features are welcome, but you must add tests!
- Improving test coverage is great, with reliable non-brittle tests.
