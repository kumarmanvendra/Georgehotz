# Quick Start Guide

This guide assumes no prior knowledge of PyTorch or any other deep learning framework but does assume some basic knowledge of neural networks. It is intended to be a very quick overview of the high-level API that tinygrad provides.

This guide is also structured as a tutorial. At the end of it, you will have a working model that can classify handwritten digits. We recommend first getting the [Basic Quick Start](basic\_quickstart.md) running and then checking out some of the [extras](extras.md).\
