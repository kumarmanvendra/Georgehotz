Where are your CONVs and MATMULs? Read the [code](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad) to solve this mystery!\n\n## Introduction to tinygrad\n\n::: {#fig-examples layout-ncol=3}\n\n![Stable diffusion](images/img1.png){#fig-stable}\n\n![GANs](images/img2.png){#fig-gans}\n\n![Yolo](images/img3.png){#fig-yolo}\n\ntinygrad supports Stable Diffusion, GANs and Yolo.\n:::\n\nThis may not be the best deep learning framework, but it is a deep learning framework!\nFor something in between [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [karpathy/micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).\ntinygrad will always be below 1000 lines.\nIf it isn't, we will revert commits until it becomes smaller.\nDue to its extreme simplicity, it aims to be the easiest framework to add new accelerators to, with support for both inference and training.\n\n## Get started with tinygrad\n\nIn order to install tinygrad run the following:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad.git\ncd tinygrad\npython3 setup.py develop\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nfrom tinygrad.tensor import Tensor\n\nx = Tensor.eye(3, requires_grad=True)\ny = Tensor([[2.0,0,-2.0]], requires_grad=True)\nz = y.matmul(x).sum()\nz.backward()\n\nprint(x.grad)  # dz/dx\nprint(y.grad)  # dz/dy\n```\n\nSame example in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nx = torch.eye(3, requires_grad=True)\ny = torch.tensor([[2.0,0,-2.0]], requires_grad=True)\nz = y.matmul(x).sum()\nz.backward()\n\nprint(x.grad)  # dz/dx\nprint(y.grad)  # dz/dy\n```\n\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n***Is tinygrad used anywhere?***\n\ntinygrad is used in [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) to run the driving model on the Snapdragon 845 GPU.\nIt replaces [SNPE](https://developer.qualcomm.com/sites/default/files/docs/snpe/overview.html).\ntinygrad is faster, supports loading ONNX files, supports training, and allows for attention (SNPE only allows fixed weights).\n\n***Is tinygrad inference only?***\n\nNo!\ntinygrad supports full forward and backward passes with autodiff.\n[This](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/mlops.py) is implemented at a level of abstraction higher than the accelerator's specific code, so a tinygrad port gets you this for free.\n\n***How can I use tinygrad for my next ML project?***\n\nFollow the installation instructions on the tinygrad [repo](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad).\nIt has a similar API to PyTorch, yet simpler and more refined.\nAlhough, while tinygrad is in alpha, it is less stable.\nSo be warned (even though it's been fairly stable for a while).\n\n***When will tinygrad leave alpha?***\n\nWhen we can reproduce a common set of papers on 1 NVIDIA GPU 2x faster than PyTorch.\nWe also want the speed to be good on the M1.\nETA, Q2 next year.\n\n***How is tinygrad faster than PyTorch?***\n\nFor most use cases it isn't yet, but it will be.\ntinygrad has three advantages:\nIt compiles a custom kernel for every operation, allowing extreme shape specialization.\nAll tensors are lazy, so it can aggressively fuse operations.\nThe backend is 10x simpler that PyTorch, meaning optimizing one kernel makes everything fast.\n\n***How can I work with the tiny corporation?***\n\nEmail me, at geohot@gmail.com.\nWe are looking for contracts and sponsorships to improve various aspects of tinygrad.\nI would also consider an internship where I work on tinygrad in the context of a company.\n\n***How can I work for the tiny corporation?***\n\nContribute to [tinygrad](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad) on GitHub.\n\n***Can I invest in the tiny corporation***\n\nIt's too tiny to have any equity to sell.\nWe are looking for contracts and sponsorships.\n\n***When are you launching your governance token? Will there be an airdrop?***\n\nBruh.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"minty"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
